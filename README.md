# TuitionGenerator

TuitionGenerator is a small and simple program that you can execute on your PC as long as you got a Java Virtual Machine (very common 
if you had ever read a java update on your computer you probably got it), this program is suposed to help user to choose
the subjects that they do want to cours on the current lective year.

The software is implemented with a MVC structure and very few librarys and elements, wich are basically AWT/SWING elements.

You can see above wich is the result of the program output:
